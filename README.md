# User Manual Kit

A starter template for building your personal "Working with Me" page using Claude Code. Fork it, fill it in with AI, deploy to GitHub Pages.

## What is this?

A single-page website that tells your teammates how to work with you — your communication style, values, schedule, personality quirks, and more. Claude Code helps you fill it in by reading your Slack profile and asking you questions.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- A GitHub account (for deployment)
- A Slack workspace you belong to (for auto-populating your profile)

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork this repo

Click **Fork** on GitHub to create your own copy.

### 2. Clone and open in Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/user-manual-kit.git
cd user-manual-kit
claude
```

### 3. Install plugins

Inside Claude Code, install the following plugins:

#### Slack (required)

Pulls your name, title, timezone, and messages to populate the template.

```
/plugin install slack@claude-plugins-official
```

After installing, you'll be prompted to authenticate via your browser. Sign in to your Slack workspace and authorize access.

#### Figma (optional)

If you want to customize the design using Figma.

```
/plugin install figma@claude-plugins-official
```

After installing, you'll be prompted to authenticate via your browser. Sign in to your Figma account and authorize access.

#### GitHub CLI (required for deployment)

The `gh` CLI is used to push your site and manage GitHub Pages. Install it on your system:

```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Linux
sudo apt install gh

# Windows
winget install GitHub.cli
```

Then authenticate:

```bash
gh auth login
```

Follow the browser flow to sign in to your GitHub account.

### 4. Fill in your manual

Once plugins are installed, copy and paste the following prompt into Claude Code:

```
You are building a personal user manual for me.

First, read my Slack profile to get my name, title, and timezone. Then read
the current index.html in this repo to understand the template structure,
sections, and placeholder content you'll be filling in.

Step 1 — Research
Use the Slack MCP to gather information about me. Specifically:
- Search for messages from me across public channels (look at at least 50–100 messages)
- Look at threads I've participated in — what topics do I engage with deeply?
- Check recent activity: what channels am I active in? What am I working on?
- Note recurring phrases, words, or emoji I use
- Identify projects, initiatives, or topics I mention frequently
- Look for how I give feedback — tone, directness, format
- Note how I communicate asynchronously vs. synchronously
- Look for values or principles I seem to care about based on what I write
- Collect raw notes. Don't synthesize yet.

Step 2 — Synthesize
From your research, infer and draft content for the following sections:
- Who I am — short punchy bio/intro in first person
- My traits — 4–6 personality/work traits with evidence from messages
- How I communicate — async vs sync preferences, response style, tone
- How to work with me well — green flags (what gets a great response from me)
- What slows me down — friction points, anti-patterns
- What I'm working on — current projects and focus areas
- What I care about — recurring themes, values, principles I reference
- My vocabulary — words, phrases, or concepts I use a lot
- Fun facts / quirks — anything interesting, surprising, or delightful

Step 3 — Build the site
Using the existing index.html as your template, fill in all placeholder content
with the synthesized information above. Preserve the HTML structure and CSS —
only replace the [bracketed placeholder] text with real content.
Make it something I'd actually want to share with teammates.
```

Claude will read your Slack profile, research your messages, synthesize what it finds, and fill in the template.

### 5. Preview locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

No build step, no dependencies, no npm.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

### Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repo on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
4. Set Branch to **main** and folder to **/ (root)**
5. Click **Save**

Your site will be live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/user-manual-kit/` within a few minutes.

### Push your changes

Once you're happy with your manual, tell Claude to commit and push:

> "Commit and push my changes"

Or do it manually:

```bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Fill in my user manual"
git push origin main
```

### Verify deployment

You can check the status of your GitHub Pages deployment with:

```bash
gh api repos/YOUR_USERNAME/user-manual-kit/pages
```

### Custom domain (optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Pages** > **Custom domain**
2. Enter your domain (e.g., `manual.yourdomain.com`)
3. Add a CNAME record with your DNS provider pointing to `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`
4. Wait for DNS propagation and HTTPS provisioning (can take up to 24 hours)

### Troubleshooting Pages

- **404 after enabling Pages?** Make sure the branch is `main` and folder is `/ (root)`. The `index.html` must be at the repo root.
- **Changes not showing up?** GitHub Pages can take 1-2 minutes to rebuild. Check the **Actions** tab for deployment status.
- **Pages option not visible?** Make sure the repo is public, or that you have GitHub Pro/Team (private repo Pages requires a paid plan).

## Switching Styles

The template ships with the **Editorial** style — a warm, light, magazine-inspired design. Two additional styles are available as Figma designs:

- **Monopo** — Dark, bold, typographic (agency-inspired)
- **Lottie** — Clean, playful, teal accents

To apply an alternative style, install the Figma plugin and tell Claude:

> "Restyle my page to match the Monopo design from this Figma: https://www.figma.com/design/AyUuvVdN3dTKaCtaUSSBZ2/Personal-User-Manual-Templates"

Claude will use the Figma MCP to read the design tokens, colors, typography, and layout from the Figma file and rewrite the CSS in your `index.html` to match.

You can also create your own custom designs in Figma and use the same workflow to apply them.

## Customizing

Everything is in one file: `index.html`. No build tools, no dependencies.

- Want to add a section? Ask Claude.
- Want a completely different visual style? Point Claude at a Figma file.
- Want to remove a section? Just delete it from the HTML.
